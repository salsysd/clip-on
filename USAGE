Description:
    Clip-on is a Rails template with Bowtie standard
    defaults.

    For full details on the changes we've made compared to
    a vanilla Rails app, check our GitHub project:
        https://github.com/bowtie/clip-on

Example:
    clip-on ~/Code/Bowtie/new-rails-app

    This generates a Rails installation in ~/Code/Bowtie configured
    with our preferred defaults.
